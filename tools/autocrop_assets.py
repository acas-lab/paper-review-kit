"""
autocrop_assets.py — content-aware figure/table cropping (no hand-tuned coords).

CRITERIA (why this is robust):
  A figure/table's true extent is defined by its GRAPHIC CONTENT — vector drawing
  paths (plot axes, arrows, table ruling lines) and raster images — NOT by guessed
  pixel rows. Body text contributes no drawings, so it can never inflate the crop.

ALGORITHM (per caption "Figure N." / "Table N."):
  1. Caption bbox + COLUMN BAND from its x-span: full / left / right.
  2. Collect graphic elements (page.get_drawings() rects + get_image_rects()),
     clipped to the page, dropping: full-page backgrounds, header (y<HEADER) /
     footer (y>FOOTER) artifacts, and near-zero-area slivers. Keep those whose
     horizontal span overlaps the caption's band.
  3. Decide the figure SIDE (above/below the caption) = whichever side has graphic
     content adjacent to the caption (figures: caption usually below; tables: vary).
  4. From the caption edge, grow a RUN of graphic elements on that side: add the
     next-nearest element while the vertical gap <= GAP (bridges multi-panel figures
     and stacked table rules); stop at a gap > GAP, another caption, or the margin.
  5. Decide full-width vs single-column from CORE content (substantial elements minus
     background panels — a localized wide rect that *contains* other elements, e.g. a
     pipeline's rounded backdrop, must not vote for full-width). Full only if core
     content covers points just left AND right of the page midline.
  6. PIXEL-TRUE MARGIN PASS (_refine_rect): render the vector rect padded, then per
     edge find the real CONTENT boundary in pixels and leave a uniform MARGIN_PX of
     whitespace. This fixes the "slightly clipped" problem the vector bbox leaves
     (anti-aliasing, glyph ascenders, plot markers, axis labels the drawing bbox
     under-reports) AND guarantees a clean margin on every side. Outward growth is
     bounded (mid-gutter for column figures, page margin for full-width; neighbour
     caption / header-footer gap vertically) so it never crosses into the other
     column's prose or a neighbouring figure.

This captures the WHOLE figure/table (all sub-panels + labels + caption) with a clean
margin, in one shot. Verify with `--verify`; eyeball the PNGs for unusual layouts.
